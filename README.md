# Notes
I created a webapp using React to allow a user to create and move various sticky notes with titles and editable markdown text. The app gives the user the functionality to move around the various sticky notes and delete them. It can be found here: http://virginiabc-hw3.surge.sh/

# Challenges
I had quite some trouble understanding how React elements interacted with each other, and the chain of events that various objects pass through. I also struggled to make the zIndex work with the various elements so the most recently interacted with sticky note would be on top. 

# Extensions
* I tried to make my notes extra pretty.
* I attempted zIndex sorting. The functionality is there and it is updating zIndex but the updated elements won't properly react to their zIndex. 
* I used opacity to highlight the note currently being interacted with, either if it's dragged or being edited.
* I made my notes resizable, so as the content increases the note increases with it.
